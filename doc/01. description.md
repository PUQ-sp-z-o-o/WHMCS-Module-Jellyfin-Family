Thanks to the module, the company can now offer public media services to its customers based on Jellyfin accounts with added flexibility.  
  
The module facilitates the creation of customer accounts on a pre-prepared Jellyfin server. Now, it empowers users to define and manage multiple media accounts, allowing for more tailored offerings and increased customer satisfaction. Each account corresponds to a selected package, enabling customers to access varied media content at different price points. Notably, clients can now possess multiple independent media accounts, broadening their media access options.
